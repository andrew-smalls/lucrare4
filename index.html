          &emsp;&emsp;The purpose of this paper is to study how the climate has
          been affected in the last 30 years in Romania and other countries,
          while taking into account the economic background of each country.
          Understanding the complex relationship be- tween economic activities

        <br />
        <p style="position: relative; top: 5em">
          &emsp;&emsp;Over the past few decades, the climate has been
          experiencing significant changes due to human activities, primarily
          the emission of gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere
          [1]. These changes have led to various environmental repercussions,
          including rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns and
          changes in ecosystems. [1]<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;In this paper, we try to determine if and how different
          economic factors influence climate indicators, by observing 12
          arbitrarily chosen countries: Australia, Brazil, Botswana, China,
          Democratic Republic of the Congo, Germany, United Kingdom, India,
          Norway, Niger, Romania and the United States, during the last 30
          years, namely 1990 - 2020.<br /><br />

          &emsp;&emsp;One of the hypothesises at the core of this paper is that
          small countries and countries that are still under development are not
          as pollutant as larger countries or already developed countries.
          However, although not as pollutant as the other ones, each country
          would suffer from climate changes, in one or multiple ways, during the
          established interval of 30 years.<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;To understand the effects of climate change on the
          mentioned countries, the following climate indicators have been
          analyzed: average yearly temperature per country, average yearly
          precipitation per country, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per country,
          burned area from forest fires, human deforestation and reforestation.
          The economical indicators studied were population per country, types
          and prevalence of industries per country, GDP and GDP growth, energy
          use, fossil fuel use and air transport.

          A. Data Acquisition and Meaning
        </h3>
        <p style="position: relative; top: 5em">
          &emsp;&emsp;All the data used throughout the elaboration of the paper
          is public and free of charge.
        </p>
        <h4 style="position: relative; top: 5em; left: 5em">
          1. Temperature and precipitation
        </h4>
        <p style="position: relative; top: 5em">
          &emsp;&emsp;Temperature and precipitation for each of the studied
          countries came from the Climate Change Knowledge Portal [2], which
          provides the users with extensive time series type datasets. The
          dataset used throughout this research is produced by the Climatic
          Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia (UEA). It is
          derived by the interpolation of monthly climate anomalies from
          extensive networks of weather station observations. 24 datasets have
          been accessed through WorldBank, 12 datasets with average yearly
          temperatures for each country studied and 12 datasets with average
          yearly precipitations for each country studied. The temperature is
          measured in degrees Celsius (C) and the precipitations are measured in
          millimeters of depth of water (mm).<br /><br />
        </p>
        <h4 style="position: relative; top: 5em; left: 5em">
          2. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions
        </h4>
        <p style="position: relative; top: 5em">
          &emsp;&emsp;A large dataset of (CO2) emissions can be found on the
          Global Carbon Atlas [3]. The platform, made possible by [4], [5], [6],
          provides the yearly carbon print for almost all countries in the
          world. The data is measured in Metric Tonnes of CO2. The original
          dataset is made up of four main datasets from historical emissions
          (1750–2019): global and national emission estimates for coal, oil,
          natural gas, and peat fuel extraction from the Carbon Dioxide
          Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) for the time period 1750–2017. The
          data is periodically reviewed by experts in the field. The emissions
          dataset takes into account energy and cement production segments, as
          these segments also produce a large amount of emissions themselves.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <h4 style="position: relative; top: 5em; left: 5em">3. Burned area</h4>
        <p style="position: relative; top: 5em">
          &emsp;&emsp;With temperatures on the rise, it’s theorized that forest
          fires would happen more often now compared to 30 years ago. In order
          to study this theory, a dataset of global monthly burned area [7] is
          used. The dataset covers burned area for the studied countries during
          2002-2019. The area of each country is split in cropland, forest,
          grass and shrubland, wetlands and other burned areas, observed each
          month since 2002 up to 2019. To make use of this data, the four
          enumerated categories have been summed in a ”total burned area” by
          country. The data itself was gathered by the means of MODIS sensors
          [8] that observe the Earth`s surface every 1 - 2 days.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <h4 style="position: relative; top: 5em; left: 5em">
          4. Forest changes - deforestation and reforestation
        </h4>
        <p style="position: relative; top: 5em">
          &emsp;&emsp;One of the potential reasons for high temperatures in the
          studied countries is losing more forest area than gaining, year after
          year. To study this, we make use of the defor- estation dataset from
          WorldBank [9], that contains data for 1990 - 2020 time interval,
          obtained from the Global Forest Resources Assessments. The Global
          Forest Resources Assessments (FRA) are now produced every five years,
          based on two primary sources of data: Country Reports prepared by
          National Correspondents and remote sensing that is conducted by FAO
          together with national focal points and regional partners. The dataset
          itself contains a catalog of countries and forest area changes
          (negative or positive numbers) by year.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <h4 style="position: relative; top: 5em; left: 5em">
          5. Population per country
        </h4>
        <p style="position: relative; top: 5em">
          &emsp;&emsp;In order to put into perspective how each inhabitant of
          the studied countries contribute to the emissions produced by the
          country, we make use of population numbers for 1990 - 2022, taken from
          another population dataset from WorldBank [10]. The dataset covers 237
          countries since 1950 up until 2022 and the data is gathered by the
          Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs
          of the United Nations Secretariat.<br /><br />

        <h4 style="position: relative; top: 5em; left: 5em">
          6. Economic data
        </h4>
        <p style="position: relative; top: 5em">
          &emsp;&emsp;For examining key economic factors and understanding
          global and regional trends, we have used the information received from
          WorldBank [10] for 1990-2020. The main indicators used are: <br />
          • GDP growth (annual %): Measures the annual growth rate of a
          country’s GDP (Gross Domestic Product) over a specific year. <br />
          • GDP per capita growth (annual %): Represents the GDP divided by the
          total population of a country.<br />
          • Forest area (sq. km): Indicates the total area of a country covered
          by forests in square kilometers.<br />
          • Rural population (% of total population): Indicates the percentage
          of a country’s population residing in rural areas.<br />
          • Urban population (% of total population): Indicates the percentage
          of a country’s population residing in urban areas. <br />
          • Energy use (kg of oil equivalent per capita): Represents the amount
          of energy consumed per capita in kilograms of oil equivalent. <br />
          • Electric power consumption (kWh per capita): Measures the
          electricity consumption per capita in kilowatt-hours.<br />
          • Population in urban agglomerations of more than 1 million (% of
          total population): Indicates the percentage of a country’s population
          living in urban agglomerations (cities) with a population of more than
          1 million.<br />
          • Industry (% of GDP): Represents the contribution of the industry
          sector, including manufacturing and construc- tion, to a country’s GDP
          as a percentage.<br />
          • Inflation (annual %): Measures the annual inflation rate based on
          changes in consumer prices.<br />
          • Imports (% of GDP): Indicates the percentage of imports of goods and
          services in relation to a country’s GDP.<br />
          •Agriculture, forestry, and fishing (% of GDP): Repre- sents the
          contribution of the agriculture, forestry, and fishing to a country’s
          GDP as a percentage.<br />
          • Fossil fuel energy consumption (% of total): Indicates the
          percentage of fossil fuel energy consumed in a country’s total energy
          consumption.<br /><br />

          B. Data Processing and Initial Visualizations
        </h3>
        <p style="position: relative; top: 5em">
          &emsp;&emsp;All datasets used throughout this research came in tabular
          form. To analyze the data, we chose to use Python, and, more
          specifically, using dataframes that can contain the data and make it
          easily accessible at all times. Therefore, each dataset downloaded had
          to be transformed into a dataframe, as part of preprocessing the data.
          This eased telling how the data looked like at a first glance.<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;For example, the average yearly temperatures, measured in
          degrees Celsius, for all countries studied can be ex- plored using the
          dataframe in figure 1. Similarily, the other dataframes contain data
          regarding precipitations, measured in millimetres of depth of water
          per year, burned area per year, measured in hectares, forest change
          per year, measured in hectares and population number per year.<br /><br />

          values, we have replaced them using the mean value of each indicator
          for the corresponding country during the period from 1990 to 2020, in
          order to maintain consistency and preserve the overall trend of the
          indicator for the given country. We have also created a Waffle Chart (

          IV. Discussion and Conclusions
        </h2>
        <br />
        <h3 style="position: relative; top: 5em; left: 5em">
          A. Discussing the results obtained
        </h3>
        <p style="position: relative; top: 5em">
          &emsp;&emsp;Starting the discussion with analysing the temperature
          changes, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, it can be observed that the temperatures,
          on average, both in Romania and in other countries, have increased
          significantly. If the average temperature in 1990 was approximately
          9.5 and 16 degrees Celsius for Romania and the average of the other
          studied countries respectively, by 2020 the new temperatures have
          increased with 1.5 degrees Celsius for Romania and 0.6 degrees Celsius
          for the other countries on average.<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;Observing the peak highs and peak lows for the average
          temperatures recorded in Romania over the last 30 years, Fig. 3, we
          can tell that after 2010 there are no low peaks in temperature to be
          found. This phenomenon, together with the steady increase in
          temperatures, could potentially continue past 2020.<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;Romania’s Heatmap in Fig. 5 paints a clear picture of
          which are the most affected counties by the increase in temperature.
          The South and the South East of Romania have an yearly average of 12 -
          13 degrees Celsius, in 2020, while the Center of the country,
          surrounded by mountains, has, in certain parts, almost half that (8
          degrees).<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;Precipitations, on average, have lower values for Romania
          than when compared to the rest of the countries studied, Fig. 6, by at
          least 230 mm per year. Although not included, the precipitations
          increased over the years in Romania. The difference between 1990 and
          2020 is not as significant as the temperature difference, but there
          exists a 50 mm difference in measured precipitations.<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;By observing the emissions produced by Romania and the
          other studied countries, it can be assessed that past 1990, emissions
          started a slow decrease for Romania, but did the opposite for the
          other countries. Fig. 7 shows Romania going from 200 MtCO2 in 1990 to
          close to 100 MtCO2 in 2020. On the other hand, the other countries
          average emissions increased from 900 MtCO2 to over 1600 MtCO2. Based
          on this, we can approximate that Romania, when compared to the other
          studied countries, emits 16 times less CO2. This decrease inCO2
          emissions can be clearly observed in Fig. 9, with the latest high peak
          in producing CO2 happening towards 2018 and the peak being 80 Mt
          CO2.<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;After analyzing the emissions produced while taking into
          account the population number of some select countries, namely
          Romania, USA and China, it can be observed that Romanians emit the
          least CO2 per capita, while Americans emit at least 3 times as much,
          but their emissions are on a descending trendline for the past 15
          years. China, however, can be seen doing the exact opposite, starting
          their increase in emissions around the same time Americans started
          their decrease, Fig. 8. By computing the total CO2 emissions of the
          studied countries, Fig. 10, it can be observed that USA and China
          combined make up at least 75% of the emissions produced during 1990 -
          2020.<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;The burned area dataset could give some insight into how
          the rise in temperatures during the years affects spontaneous fires,
          which could lead to large portions of burnt area. However, the data
          visualizations do not support this claim, Fig. 11, with burned area
          reaching a maximum, for Romania, in 2007 - 2008, with a summer that
          burned almost 450000 hectares. After 2008, the burned area decreases
          year after year.<br /><br />

        <p style="position: relative; top: 5em">
          &emsp;&emsp;Although a correlation between higher temperatures and
          larger burned area cannot be established, it is certain that the
          summers are the highest contributors to burned area. Almost 60% of
          total burnt area, summed over a time span of 17 years observed in
          Romania, has happened during summer, Fig. 12.<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;Deforestation is on the rise and this phenomenon can be
          observed in Fig. 13 as well. Even before 1990, the rates of
          deforestation, or the rate of forest area becoming smaller by the
          year, has been disproportionate to the frequency of reforestation. For
          Romania, the rate of deforestation is not larger than the
          reforestation, but when observing the overall situation for all
          countries in this study, it can be assessed that the reforestation
          area, measured in millions of hectares, is at least twice as small
          compared to deforestation, which trends to increase in the future.<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;In Fig 14. there can be observed the air transport for
          each country, which is very important because, as shown in the Fig.
          16, there is a strong correlation between the usage of air transport
          and the level of CO2 emissions. As it can be observed, from the
          horizontal bar chart, USA and China have the biggest impact on the
          airplane traffic. Although not shown in the paper, even if we consider
          the airplane transport per population, these two countries are on the
          top of this list. Moreover, there was a decline in the air transport
          for 2020, which might be due to it being the year when the COVID
          pandemic has started.<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;In Fig 15. we can see how much electric power each country
          consumes. Surprisingly, Norway and Australia are very high on this
          list having almost 50% on this distribution, despite not having a huge
          population.<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;Analysing the dependency between air transport and the
          consumption of fossil fuel energy, Fig. 15 and Fig. 16, it can clearly
          be observed that there is a strong connection between the amount of
          usage of airplanes over the years for all the countries and the CO2
          emissions. In the second plot, we can observe the obvious exponential
          dependency between the consumption of energy based on fossil fuel and
          the carbon dioxide emissions.<br /><br />

          B. Comparing with the state-of-the-art
        </h3>
        <p style="position: relative; top: 5em">
          &emsp;&emsp;In one of the studies related to climate change research
          for Romania, done in 2019, Elena Mateescu identifies year 2018 as
          hottest year in the last 30 years and computes the temperature
          difference between 2018 and 1988 to be 1.58 degrees Celsius [11]. This
          is in accordance with the peaks and temperature differences found in
          our research as well, therefore giving the temperature dataset used
          throughout this research more integrity and further supporting the
          validity of the claims of this paper. The author warns that if the
          trend continues, we can expect to see a 5 to 6 degrees Celsius
          difference starting 2071 (referencing the 1971 baseline).<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;In another study from 2021, authors have similar results
          when comparing our researched CO2 emissions with their researched CO2
          emissions. Besides the similarity in results, the authors make use of
          regression models to forecast how the emissions will evolve in the
          future. The current prediction is reaching 60 MtCO2 by 2030 and net 0
          emissions post 2050 [12].<br /><br />

        <h3 style="position: relative; top: 5em; left: 5em">C. Conclusions</h3>
        <p style="position: relative; top: 5em">
          &emsp;&emsp;Climate change has resulted in significant temperature
          increases globally, including Romania, with an average temperature
          rise of approximately 1.5 degrees Celsius over the past 30 years. This
          increasing trend is expected to continue beyond 2020.<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;The increase in temperatures has not been evenly
          distributed across Romania, with the southern regions experiencing
          higher average temperatures compared to the mountainous central
          regions. Precipitations have shown a slight increase over the years,
          although they remain lower than the average precipitation levels in
          the other studied countries.<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;Romania has achieved a notable reduction in CO2 emissions
          over the past 30 years with emissions decreasing from 200 MtCO2 in
          1990 to around 100 MtCO2 in 2020. This reduction is in contrast to the
          increasing emissions observed in the other studied countries.<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;While this research provides valuable insights into the
          relationship between economic factors and climate change, it is
          important to acknowledge several limitations. The data on which this
          study relied on may be subject to measurement errors or
          inconsistencies. Besides, the analysis focused on a small set of
          economic indicators and did not account for all possible variables
          that could influence climate change. Another limitation is
          establishing causality between economic factors and climate change,
          which is challenging.<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;Despite the mentioned limitations, this research yielded
          significant results, similar to results obtained by related work in
          the field of climate change for Romania. The findings of this study
          could be further used to promote significant policies for addressing
          the negative effects of economic factors on climate change.
          Policymakers should consider implementing policies to promote
          sustainable practices and using renewable energy sources. Going
          forward, towards the zero emissions target, incorporating this type of
          insights into policy development should become a priority not only for
          Romania, but for the whole world.<br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;In conclusion, this research highlights the intricate
          relationship between economic factors and climate change. The findings
          underscore the need for proactive policy measures that promote
          sustainable economic practices and mitigate the negative impact of
          economic activities on the environment.<br /><br />
